# AGENTS.md — Faultline

Read this first. Then `PRD.md` (product plan) and `contracts/README.md` (interface spec).

## What Faultline is

An autonomous incident responder. When telemetry can't distinguish causes that fit the same symptoms, Faultline runs a safe, reversible experiment on the live system to tell them apart. Hero case: self-sustaining retry storm vs. degraded DB — cap retries; if the system stays healthy after release it was a storm, if the storm returns the DB is degraded. **The LLM proposes and explains; measurement against noise decides.**

## Repo layout

| Path | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `contracts/` | shared | Built — interfaces C1–C5, fakes, fixtures, schemas, tests |
| `sandbox/` | 1 Sandbox + storm | Not started — Docker Compose target system, Envoy, fault controller |
| `faultline/telemetry/` | 2 Telemetry + Elastic | Not started — OTel → ES, fingerprint queries, ES audit sink |
| `faultline/brain/` | 3 Brain | Not started — OpenAI triage, noise model, planner, judge |
| `faultline/{adapters,orchestrator,cli,ui}/` | 4 Product | Not started — lever/code adapters, state machine, CLI, UI |
| `bench/` | 3 Brain | Not started — benchmark runner and baselines |

Stay inside your owner's directories. Talk to other components only through `faultline_contracts`.

## Setup

```bash
cd contracts && uv sync && uv run pytest -q     # should be all green
uv run python examples/run_hero.py              # see the hero experiment in each simulated world
```

Other packages depend on contracts via `uv add --editable ../contracts` (path adjusted).

## The contracts (`contracts/src/faultline_contracts/`)

| # | Module | What | Producer → Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `fingerprint.py` | `Fingerprint` (one 5 s window: services, db, edges, slos, log_highlights, change_events); `.metrics()` → flat canonical keys; `TelemetrySource` protocol (`window`, `series`) | Telemetry → Brain, UI |
| C2 | `triage.py` | `TriageDraft` = exact LLM output (hypotheses, direction predictions per experiment, structured `confirms_if`); use `openai_schema.triage_response_format()` for OpenAI strict mode; validate with `.problems()`. `Verdict` = math output (diagnosis or `NONE_OF_THE_ABOVE`, support, observations with z-scores) | Brain → Orchestrator, UI |
| C3 | `levers.py` | `LeverAdapter` protocol (`catalog`, `estimate_blast_radius`, `apply(lever_id, params, ttl_s)`, `undo`, `status`); `CATALOG`: `retry_cap`, `shed`, `db_failover`, `canary_weight`; `Experiment` = apply → hold → undo | Adapters → Brain, Orchestrator |
| C4 | `audit.py` | `AuditEvent` (stage 1–8, kind, actor); `AuditSink` protocol, `JsonlSink`; ES index `faultline-audit`; `experiment_windows()` derives phase boundaries | Orchestrator → ES, UI |
| C5 | `fault.py` | Fault controller API (:9900) + `HttpFaultController`. **Hidden from Faultline** | Sandbox → `bench/` only |

`metrics.py` is the metric-key registry: `svc.<svc>.<field>`, `db.<field>`, `edge.<src>.<dst>.<field>`, `slo.<name>.value`.

Sandbox control endpoints for real levers (Owner 1 serves, Owner 4 calls) are defined in `contracts/README.md`: control service on :9901, `POST`/`DELETE /admin/{retry_override,shed,db/failover,canary}`, every `POST` takes `ttl_s`.

## Fakes — build against these until the real thing exists

- `fakes.FakeWorld` — seeded simulator of the hero sandbox; implements `TelemetrySource`, `LeverAdapter` and `FaultController` in one object. Worlds: storm (retry cap fixes it permanently), degraded_db (cap doesn't help, storm returns; failover heals), cpu_starve (fits neither → none-of-the-above). Time advances only via `world.advance(seconds)`.
- `fakes.FakeLeverAdapter` — records actions, injectable clock for TTL tests.
- `fakes.ReplayTelemetrySource` — replays fixture JSON.
- `contracts/fixtures/` — healthy/storm/degraded fingerprints, full experiment series for both worlds, sample triage, verdict, catalog, experiments, audit trail.

## Rules

- **Fairness (enforced by `tests/test_boundary.py`):** code under `faultline/` must never import `faultline_contracts.fault`; runtime code must not import `faultline_contracts.fakes` (tests may). Never put world/fault labels or trigger timing in telemetry.
- **Units:** `_ms`, `_qps`, ratios/rates in 0–1. UTC timestamps. 5 s windows (`WINDOW_S`).
- **Missing data is omitted (`None`), never 0** — otherwise the judge reads a fake drop.
- **Don't hardcode latency thresholds.** Fixture and simulator magnitudes differ; derive baselines from the noise model (σ = max(std, 10% of typical), significant at ~3σ).
- Models use `extra="forbid"` and carry `schema_version`. Don't depend on event order within the same audit timestamp.
- **Changing contracts:** PR approved by the consuming owner. After model changes run `uv run python scripts/make_fixtures.py && uv run python scripts/export_schemas.py`; a test fails if schemas are stale.
- Every lever action must be reversible and carry a TTL. Action budget: 5 per incident, then page a human.
- LLM calls use the OpenAI API (sponsor requirement). Log notable Codex usage for the Devpost write-up.
- Only measured numbers go on slides; say "handles performance and availability incidents", never "handles everything".
